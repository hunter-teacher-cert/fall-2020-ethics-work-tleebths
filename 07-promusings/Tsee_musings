1. Public Policy
[Congress should look for villains other than the tech giants](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/congress-should-look-for-villains-other-than-the-tech-giants/2020/10/14/c3a0b89a-0d85-11eb-8a35-237ef1eb2ef7_story.html)
I was greatly disturbed by this opinion piece. It pointed to past monopolies or industry leaders, from A&P to IBM,
as proof that today's tech giants will one day be overthrown. This ignores two things: the vast extent of the control
from the likes of Google and Facebook over its business partners (exertion of monopoly powers), and more importantly,
the role of antitrust oversight that restrained those monopolies so that competitors can arise and fight.

[Congress Doesnâ€™t Get Big Tech. By Design.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/congress-big-tech.html)
This reflection on seemingly dumb things said by Congresspeople during high-tech companies hearings reminds us
that tech companies are guilty of hiding what they do and obfuscating it when questioned. Elected officials generally
did ask smart questions, but they were evaded. Laughing at government officials also reinforces the industry
narrative that they're the only smart people in the room, and that government oversight is  unnecessary and would be
detrimental to the industry.

Banks were too big to fail (and still are), and government oversight was deemed pointless by the financial industry.
This led to the Great Recession and subsequent political turmoil that has led to very dangerous situations here and
abroad.

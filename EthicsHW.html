<title>Understanding WCAG with examples</title>

<H1>
Welcome!
</H1>
<H2>
The purpose of this page is to briefly discuss the principles of the <A HREF = "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</A>.
</H2>
<H3>
The discussion of each principle will include an example and non-example.
</H3>
While this page may not be fancy, it strives to meet accessibility guidelines.
<p>
<u1><li>I will use clear and simple language, in order to ensure that the page is understandable.</li>
<li>I will use hierarchical tags, like headings, in order to ensure that the page is robust.</li>
<li>I will not set any colors or fonts, so that viewers can perceive the content according to their own browser settings.</li>
<li>I will give pointers about the structure of the page, so that the page is operable.</li>
</u1>
<p>
<H3>Accessible web content should be perceivable.</H3>
<p>
This means that "information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive" (<A HREF = "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">source</A>). Making content perceivable to visually impaired users means that it should be accessible by screen readers. Visual elements on the page should be presented in high-contrast color schemes. Making content perceivable to those with hearing loss means that any audio content should be accompanied by explanatory text. In the case of audio speech, captions help make content accessible. Simultaneous sign-language interpretation is also helpful in making content perceivable by those with hearing loss.
<p>
One example of web content that meets WCAG for accessibility is this <A HREF = "https://youtu.be/HWrTECbCYAw">video of a press conference by Bill de Blasio</A>. It includes captions and sign language interpretation.
<p>
One example of poorly-perceivable web content is this snapshot from the bottom of the website <A HREF = "http://www.united.com">United.com</A>. The snapshot shows several columns of links. The text of each link is dark gray on a background of light gray. This low contrast makes these links hard to see.

<H3>Accessible web content should be operable.</H3>
<p>
Web content is operable when a user can navigate and interact with the site. This means the site should indicate how a page relates to the rest of the site. There should be clear navigation tools that permit a user to go quickly to another part of the site. And it means that a user can interact with the site using a variety of input devices, such as a mouse, or a keyboard, or other devices.
<p>
One example of a website with highly operable navigation features is <A HREF = "http://www.va.gov">VA.gov</A>. The site shows the route traced from the home page to the current page. A panel on the left shows other related pages within the same section. A snapshot of some of these navigation / operability features is below.
<p>
<hr>
<img src = "vass.png" alt = "navigation tools from VA.gov.">
<hr>
<p>
A website element that interferes with operability is a pop-up ad. A pop-up ad is an example of an interruption, which violates WCAG success criterion 2.2.4. A pop-up interferes with the accessibility of a site because it requires the user to stop using the site and clear the ad before they can continue. Below is an irritating pop-up from <A HREF = "http://www.nypost.com">NYPost.com</A>.
<p>
<hr>
<img src = "popup.png" alt = "a pop-up ad that interrupts use of NYPost.com.">
<p>
<hr>
<H3>Accessible web content should be understandable.</H3>
<p>
Web content is understandable when it conveys information in ways that the user is familiar with. Understandable web content does not use complicated language when simple language is available. Understandable web pages "appear and operate in predictable ways," and can "help users avoid and correct mistakes" (<A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#predictable">source</A>).
<p>
The <A HREF = "http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</A> website is understandable because, even though the content of the site changes frequently, the organization and navigation of the site is predictable. The authors of the site are careful to use the clearest language possible.
<p>
An example of less understandable web content is a section from the Zoom Settings page on the NYCDOE TeachHub site. While many users may understand the full functionality of these settings, this teacher was never able to. A link to "Learn more" seems like it would be helpful. But because even after reviewing this page it was hard to understand the connection between the information in these settings, and who was actually permitted or denied entry to Zoom meetings, this section of the settings was less than understandable.

<H3>Accessible web content should be robust.</H3>
<p>
Web content is robust when it "maximize[s] compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies." This means that the best web content isn't just narrowly accessible to a small set of users and technologies. Instead, it's accessible to a broad range of current and future human and technological "users."
<p>
One site that seems particularly robust is <A HREF = "https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</A>. Google Maps is robust because it offers a range of options for user input. A user can enter a full or partial address, or the name of a business, or even the name of a contact whose address is stored in the user's Google Contacts list. The site displays maps at a variety of resolutions, offers directions, satellite and map views, and a range of orientations for viewing. The variety of options for user input and output means that the site is accessible to a range of users with different purposes. Google Maps also functions with a range of apps and other technologies to make its features widely accessible.
